## Summer Activities
During my last summer as a highschooler I went to this river that was sort of known and was in the mountains kind of. I went with a lot of my friends, we all swam and talked. We went for my brothers birthday and 2 other of my friend's because they were all born in July towards the end of the month. Another activity I participated in during the summer was that we also went to the beach from 9-3. We basically just hungout and ate, the water was pretty cool.
