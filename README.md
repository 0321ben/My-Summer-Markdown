# My-Summer-Markdown
## Introduction
My Name is Benjamin Ochoa and I'm in 12th grade. I work in fast food and I like hanging out with friends.

## Summer Activities
During my last summer as a highschooler I went to this river that was sort of known and was in the mountains kind of. I went with a lot of my friends, we all swam and talked. We went for my brothers birthday and 2 other of my friend's because they were all born in July towards the end of the month. Another activity I participated in during the summer was that we also went to the beach from like 9-3. We basically just hungout and ate, the water was pretty cool.

## Favorite Summer Food
During the summer, my favorite summer food was watermelon. Probabaly the best food to cool yourself down during the hot summer days.

## Personal Achievements
A personal achievement I achieved during the summer was getting a job. I have been searching for jobs and I set myself a milestone to get one before summer ended which I did.

## Goals for The School Year
- Graduate
- Chill/Relax
